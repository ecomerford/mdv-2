## mdv2

[mdv2](https://mozilla.github.io/mdv2-prototype/) is a prototype Telemetry
Mesurement Dashboard built to evaluate designs and architectures for
suitability as a replacement for the venerable telemetry.mozilla.org
[Measurement Dashboard](https://telemetry.mozilla.org/new-pipeline/dist.html).

It is built with sample data, a custom data format, React components, Bootstrap
styling, Plotly plots, and the help of many people.

This project owes its design and architecture to the work of
[Erin Comerford](https://github.com/ecomerford) over the course of her Outreachy
internship in 2018.
